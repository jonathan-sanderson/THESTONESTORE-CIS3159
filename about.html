          <button class="faq">WHAT ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MARBLE, GRANITE AND QUARTZ?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>There are dozens of different materials you could choose for your kitchen or bathroom worktops. In fact, as styles evolve, we are seeing materials traditionally exclusive to these spaces appearing throughout the home for more synchronicity and flow. When it comes to marble, granite and quartz, however – there is an extra feeling of luxury that all three offers to any home.<br><br>
              Although often discussed together, these three materials differ in numerous ways, each bringing its own set of benefits to a space – but what are the differences?<br><br>
              Both granite and marble worktops are actually natural stone slabs. Unlike quartz, which is man- made, a fact that many don’t realise.<br><br>
              Granite and marble are quarried from the ground in large blocks which are then cut, shaped and polished to fit the customer’s requirements. Quartz worktops are made from around 90% crushed quartz and then mixed with approximately 7% resin, polymers and pigments.<br><br>
              As Quartz worktops are manufactured, they come in a wide range of colours, and designs – providing variety for those customers who have something specific in mind. Granite, however, comes in more natural stone colours.<br><br>
              Marble is very distinctive with its veined appearance and is most often seen in black and white.<br>
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <button class="faq">WHICH IS CHEAPER, GRANITE OR QUARTZ?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>This depends on many things and unfortunately, there is no straightforward answer! The price is down to several factors including which brand it is, and – in the case of marble and granite – where it has come from. The thickness of the worktops is obviously a factor, and some of the cheaper brands achieve a lower price by offering thinner cuts of the marble, granite or quartz.<br><br>
              In the long term, cheap quartz can stain, and the surface can become textured. However cheap granite is rarely a good quality, and this can be spotted a mile off.<br><br>
              We would always recommend shopping around and going to see the material you will be buying, before you commit.<br>
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <button class="faq">HOW DO I KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT FOR MY KITCHEN?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Granite is one of the most popular materials for kitchen worktops and looks great in both modern and traditional houses. This is primarily thanks to its neutral design and high durability, making it ideal for a range of applications.<br><br>
              Marble is a popular choice for high-end homes as it has long been associated with luxury.<br><br>
              Quartz, as previously mentioned, comes in a fantastic range of colours including colours not found in the natural stone shades of marble and granite.<br><br>
              In the end, the choice for most people between marble, granite, and quartz comes down to their personal preference on the appearance of the worktops; the bottom line is that either granite, marble or quartz will add the wow factor to your kitchen, bathroom – or anywhere else for that matter! It can also potentially add value to your home.<br><br>
              Our showroom is the ideal place to come and see examples of marble, granite, and quartz to help you decide which one is right for you.<br></p>
          </div>

          <button class="faq">WHICH IS MORE HARD-WEARING?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Granite and marble are both naturally porous stones, and so must be sealed to prevent staining. We recommend that this is done every year. Quartz is non-porous and so does not require sealing. Of the three materials, quartz and granite are the strongest.<br><br>
              That being said, between granite and quartz, granite is much less likely to show signs of wear with scratches or marks – and so those opting for quartz should take extra care to avoid any damage being done.<br></p>
